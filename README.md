# jaimerios.dev

The default [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper) template, available for Rollup and webpack.

## Description
This project includes code for jaimerios.dev. This website intended to:

- Share information about me and the services I provide.
- Showcase my work.
- Provide people with an easy way to get in touch.
- Host my own blog.

<!-- TODO: Add Badges -->

<!-- TODO: Visuals, specially a compelling image about my website -->

<!-- TODO: Usage: URL to my blog -->
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

<!-- TODO: Add Support section
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc. -->
